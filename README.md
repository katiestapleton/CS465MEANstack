It was developed as a single page application to allow for easier updates in design, layout, and storage. The backend used a NoSQL database due to its flexibility in data storage.

JavaScript is a full language commonly used in web development. JSON is derived from JavaScript. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON formats and stores data through key:pair values.

Honestly, this course did NOT help me reach my professional goals. Overall, I have learned the important of staying updated about the changes between languages, libraries, and plugin. I understand the basics of Angular, but not to the appropriate level. Angular 6 to 7 has some drastic changes. I have not yet figured out all the changes I need to apply to my site.
